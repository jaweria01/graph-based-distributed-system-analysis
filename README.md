# graph-based-distributed-system-analysis
This project models microservice interactions using graph-based techniques to analyze system behavior, dependencies, and failure patterns. Analyzes system logs using graphs to identify critical services and bottlenecks,reliability issues. The project demonstrates how graph analysis can support understanding and improving distributed system design.
