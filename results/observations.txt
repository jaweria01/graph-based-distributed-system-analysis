Project: Graph-Based Analysis of Distributed System Behavior

Observations:

1. The system shows a centralized structure where the Frontend and Database
   services play critical roles.

2. The Database has a high number of incoming connections, making it a
   potential bottleneck and single point of failure.

3. The Payment service shows multiple failure edges, indicating instability
   and higher risk during transactions.

4. Failures propagate through dependent services, demonstrating how tightly
   coupled services can affect overall system reliability.

5. The graph-based representation helps identify critical services, failure
   paths, and improvement areas in distributed system design.

Conclusion:
This analysis shows how graph-based modeling can be used to understand
communication patterns, detect system weaknesses, and support reliability
analysis in distributed systems.
